Create a python function that accepts "specified_player" (text) 
and "pgn_txt" (text containing multiple chess pgns), 
opening_moves as variables.
Opening phase is when full moves are until opening_moves,
middle/endgame is when the full moves are above opening_moves.
You can refer to Chess.com api to test the extraction of pgns
of the player 'macspacs' in May 2024 as example

The function must extract and put into Pandas dataframe a row for each pgn in 
pgn_txt data containing:
1) datetime of the game (in ascending order)
2) game type (use 'TimeControl' which is expressed in seconds and transform
it in "h:mm:ss" notation)
3) specified_player elo
4) specified_player color
5) other opponent elo (indicates only 'opponent' and not the full name)
6) elo difference between specified_player and other opponent preserving 
the algebric sign of the difference
7) specified_player final result
8) remaining time of specified_player (in mm:ss notation) at the end of the game
9) "Termination" tag text
10) specified_player result (won, lost, drew)
11) opening as part of the text in "ECOUrl" tag after the "openings/" subtext.
12) number of full chess moves played
13) Average move time for specified_player (in mm:ss notation) 
in the opening phase.
14) Average move time for specified_player in middle/endgame

All the data must be placed into a Pandas dataframe
Every row must be a game
